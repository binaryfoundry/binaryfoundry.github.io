## Fisica

Mass GPU physics simulator. A unique algorithm allows mobile compatible simulation of 100,000~1,000,000 bodies, with stable stacking and constraints on GPU. The key to this algorithm is eliminating the need for bottom up resolution order for stable stacking.

## Reach3Dx

A Unity like engine I created in 2012/13 and took to GDC. Supports targets for HTML5 and native code for mobile/desktop. The first 3D engine to support HTML5.

* Fully featured 3D game engine in 35,000 lines of code.
* Prototype based entity modeling using RTTI meta data for dynamic editing in tools.
* Deep C# tools interop. with WebKit/Chromium.
* COLLADA loader with full boned animation.
* Full post-processing pipeline and colour correction.
* 100km of lazy loaded, geo-mipmapped terrain.
* Revolutionary graph based rendering design.
* Native code compilation for mobile.
* Full atmospheric scattering and aerial perspective.
* Shadow-mapping.
* Forward and Light-Prepass rendering options.
* 60fps 3D in HTML5.
* Materials system shader builder.
* Fully JSON data driven world and scripting.
* Completed in 2 months with two developers.

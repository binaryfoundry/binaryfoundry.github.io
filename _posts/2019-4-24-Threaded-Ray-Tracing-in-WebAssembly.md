title: Threaded Ray Tracing in WebAssembly
---

WebAssembly threads are available to try, so here's Ray Tracing in One Weekend ported to make use of WASM threads. Done unobtrusively to keep it simple. Probably only working on Chrome so far and with some flags enabled described on the page.

Also generates Visual Studio projects which is useful for RTOW readers on Windows.

title: FizzBuzz in Keras
---

Recently my lunch hour afforded some time for one of my favourite things, promoting #DerpLearning on Twitter. So I ported [Joel Grus FizzBuzz in TensorFlow](http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) to Keras.

New front end APIs abstracting much of the setup required for Deep Learning takes away somewhat from Joel's joke, but I predict democratization will lead to much more advanced #DerpLearning.

This image shows Keras output vs a correct FizzBuzz. In some effort to maintain the geek comedy, there are still some errors but adjusting parameters for a correct output is trivial. [Here is the Gist](https://gist.github.com/mechanicsfoundry/3bd4e3c1ee13b7e35f454689b0ef2fa1) on GitHub.
